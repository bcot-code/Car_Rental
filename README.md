# Car Rental Application

This project contains the client-side code for the Car Rental application.

## Project Structure

- All source code is located inside the `client` directory.
- The client interacts with the main backend server through API requests.

## How It Works

- The client-side code handles the user interface and communicates with the backend to fetch and update data.
- To access the main backend, the client sends HTTP requests (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to the server's endpoints.
- All business logic and data storage are managed by the backend, while the client is responsible for presenting data and handling user interactions.

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the `client` directory.
2. Follow the setup instructions in the `client/README.md` (if available) to install dependencies and run the client.
3. Ensure the backend server is running to enable full functionality.
